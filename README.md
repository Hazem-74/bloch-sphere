# Bloch Sphere Project

This repository contains Python scripts for visualizing and interacting with quantum states on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a powerful geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system (qubit). These scripts leverage the `qutip` library for rendering the Bloch sphere and `matplotlib` for creating interactive user interfaces, allowing for dynamic exploration of qubit states.


## Project Overview

The "Bloch Sphere" project aims to provide intuitive tools to understand how a qubit's state, defined by its complex superposition coefficients ($\alpha, \beta$) or its spherical coordinates ($\theta, \phi$), maps to a unique point on the Bloch sphere. The interactive scripts facilitate hands-on learning by allowing users to manipulate these parameters and observe the state change in real-time.

## Requirements

To run these Python scripts, you will need the following libraries installed:

*   `Python 3.x`
*   `numpy`
*   `qutip`
*   `matplotlib`
